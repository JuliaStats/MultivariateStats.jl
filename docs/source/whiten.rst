Data Whitening
================

A `whitening transformation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_transformation>`_ is a decorrelation transformation that transforms a set of random variables into a set of new random variables with identity covariance (uncorrelated with unit variances).

In particular, suppose a random vector has covariance :math:`\mathbf{C}`, then a whitening transform :math:`\mathbf{W}` is one that satisfy:

.. math::

    \mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{I}

Note that :math:`\mathbf{W}` is generally not unique. In particular, if :math:`\mathbf{W}` is a whitening transform, so is any of its rotation :math:`\mathbf{W} \mathbf{R}` with :math:`\mathbf{R}^T \mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I}`.

Whitening
~~~~~~~~~~~

The package uses ``Whitening`` defined below to represent a whitening transform:

.. code-block:: julia

    struct Whitening{T<:FloatingPoint}
        mean::Vector{T}     # mean vector (can be empty to indicate zero mean), of length d
        W::Matrix{T}        # the transform coefficient matrix, of size (d, d)
    end

An instance of ``Whitening`` can be constructed by ``Whitening(mean, W)``. 

There are several functions to access the properties of a whitening transform ``f``:

.. function:: indim(f)

    Get the input dimension, *i.e* ``d``.

.. function:: outdim(f)

    Get the out dimension, *i.e* ``d``.

.. function:: mean(f)

    Get the mean vector. 

    **Note:** if ``f.mean`` is empty, this function returns a zero vector of length ``d``.

.. function:: transform(f, x)

    Apply the whitening transform to a vector or a matrix with samples in columns, as :math:`\mathbf{W}^T (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})`.


Data Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a dataset, one can use the ``fit`` method to estimate a whitening transform.

.. function:: fit(Whitening, X; ...)

    Estimate a whitening transform from the data given in ``X``. Here, ``X`` should be a matrix, whose columns give the samples.

    This function returns an instance of ``Whitening``.

    **Keyword Arguments:**

    =========== ======================================================= ===============
     name         description                                             default
    =========== ======================================================= ===============
     regcoef    The regularization coefficient. The covariance will       ``zero(T)``
                be regularized as follows when ``regcoef`` is positive:

                ``C + (eigmax(C) * regcoef) * eye(d)``
    ----------- ------------------------------------------------------- ---------------
     mean       The mean vector, which can be either of:                  ``nothing``

                - ``0``: the input data has already been centralized
                - ``nothing``: this function will compute the mean
                - a pre-computed mean vector
    =========== ======================================================= ===============

    **Note:** This function internally relies on ``cov_whiten`` to derive the transformation ``W``. The function ``cov_whiten`` itself is also a useful function.


.. function:: cov_whitening(C)

    Derive the whitening transform coefficient matrix ``W`` given the covariance matrix ``C``. Here, ``C`` can be either a square matrix, or an instance of ``Cholesky``.

    Internally, this function solves the whitening transform using Cholesky factorization. The rationale is as follows: let :math:`\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{U}^T \mathbf{U}` and :math:`\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{U}^{-1}`, then :math:`\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{C} \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{I}`.

    **Note:** The return matrix ``W`` is an upper triangular matrix.

.. function:: cov_whitening(C, regcoef)

    Derive a whitening transform based on a regularized covariance, as ``C + (eigmax(C) * regcoef) * eye(d)``.

In addition, the package also provides ``cov_whiten!``, in which the input matrix ``C`` will be overwritten during computation. This can be more efficient when ``C`` is no longer used. 

.. function:: invsqrtm(C)

    Compute ``inv(sqrtm(C))`` through symmetric eigenvalue decomposition.
