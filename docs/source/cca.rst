Canonical Correlation Analysis
===============================

`Canonical Correlation Analysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation>`_ (CCA) is a statistical analysis technique to identify correlations between two sets of variables. Given two vector variables ``X`` and ``Y``, it finds two projections, one for each, to transform them to a common space with maximum correlations.

The package defines a ``CCA`` type to represent a CCA model, and provides a set of methods to access the properties.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~

Let ``M`` be an instance of ``CCA``, ``dx`` be the dimension of ``X``, ``dy`` the dimension of ``Y``, and ``p`` the output dimension (*i.e* the dimensio of the common space).

.. function:: xindim(M)

    Get the dimension of ``X``, the first set of variables.

.. function:: yindim(M)

    Get the dimension of ``Y``, the second set of variables.

.. function:: outdim(M)

    Get the output dimension, *i.e* that of the common space.

.. function:: xmean(M)

    Get the mean vector of ``X`` (of length ``dx``).

.. function:: ymean(M)

    Get the mean vector of ``Y`` (of length ``dy``).

.. function:: xprojection(M)

    Get the projection matrix for ``X`` (of size ``(dx, p)``).

.. function:: yprojection(M)

    Get the projection matrix for ``Y`` (of size ``(dy, p)``).

.. function:: correlations(M)

    The correlations of the projected componnents (a vector of length ``p``).

Transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a CCA model, one can transform observations into both spaces into a common space, as

.. math::

    \mathbf{z}_x = \mathbf{P}_x^T (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_x) \\
    \mathbf{z}_y = \mathbf{P}_y^T (\mathbf{y} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_y)

Here, :math:`\mathbf{P}_x` and :math:`\mathbf{P}_y` are projection matrices for ``X`` and ``Y``; :math:`\boldsymbol{\mu}_x` and :math:`\boldsymbol{\mu}_y` are mean vectors. 

This package provides methods to do so:

.. function:: xtransform(M, x)

    Transform observations in the X-space to the common space. 

    Here, ``x`` can be either a vector of length ``dx`` or a matrix where each column is an observation.

.. function:: ytransform(M, y)

    Transform observations in the Y-space to the common space. 

    Here, ``y`` can be either a vector of length ``dy`` or a matrix where each column is an observation.


Data Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can use the ``fit`` method to perform CCA over given datasets.

.. function:: fit(CCA, X, Y; ...)

    Perform CCA over the data given in matrices ``X`` and ``Y``. Each column of ``X`` and ``Y`` is an observation.

    ``X`` and ``Y`` should have the same number of columns (denoted by ``n`` below).

    This method returns an instance of ``CCA``.

                - ``:cov``: based on covariance matrices

    ----------- --------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------

    ----------- --------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------
     mean       The mean vector, which can be either of:                         ``nothing``

                - ``0``: the input data has already been centralized
                - ``nothing``: this function will compute the mean
                - a pre-computed mean vector
    =========== =============================================================== ====================

    **Notes:** This function calls ``ccacov`` or ``ccasvd`` internally, depending on the choice of method.

    :param xmean: The mean vector of the original samples of ``X``, 
                  which can be a vector of length ``dx``, or an empty vector 
                  ``Float64[]`` indicating a zero mean.

    :param ymean: The mean vector of the original samples of ``Y``, 
                  which can be a vector of length ``dy``, or an empty vector 
                  ``Float64[]`` indicating a zero mean.
