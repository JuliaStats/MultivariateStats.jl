Linear Least Square and Ridge Regression
==========================================

The package provides functions to perform *Linear Least Square* and *Ridge Regression*.


Linear Least Square
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Linear Least Square <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_(mathematics)>`_ is to find linear combination(s) of given variables to fit the responses by minimizing the squared error between them. This can be formulated as an optimization as follows:

.. math::

    \mathop{\mathrm{minimize}}_{(\mathbf{a}, b)} \
    \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{y} - (\mathbf{X} \mathbf{a} + b)\|^2

Sometimes, the coefficient matrix is given in a transposed form, in which case, the optimization is modified as:

.. math::

    \mathop{\mathrm{minimize}}_{(\mathbf{a}, b)} \
    \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{y} - (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{a} + b)\|^2

The package provides ``llsq`` to solve these problems:

.. function:: llsq(X, y; ...)

    Solve the linear least square problem formulated above.

    Here, ``y`` can be either a vector, or a matrix where each column is a response vector.

    This function accepts two keyword arguments:

    - ``dims``: whether input observations are stored as rows (``1``) or columns (``2``). (default is ``1``)
    - ``bias``: whether to include the bias term ``b``. (default is ``true``)

    The function results the solution ``a``.
    In particular, when ``y`` is a vector (matrix), ``a`` is also a vector (matrix). If ``bias`` is true, then the returned array is augmented as ``[a; b]``.

**Examples**

For a single response vector ``y`` (without using bias):

.. code-block:: julia

    using Statistics, MultivariateStats

    # prepare data
    X = rand(1000, 3)               # feature matrix
    a0 = rand(3)                    # ground truths
    y = X * a0 + 0.1 * randn(1000)  # generate response

    # solve using llsq
    a = llsq(X, y; bias=false)

    # do prediction
    yp = X * a

    # measure the error
    rmse = sqrt(mean(abs2.(y - yp)))
    print("rmse = $rmse")

For a single response vector ``y`` (using bias):

.. code-block:: julia

    # prepare data
    X = rand(1000, 3)
    a0, b0 = rand(3), rand()
    y = X * a0 .+ b0 .+ 0.1 * randn(1000)

    # solve using llsq
    sol = llsq(X, y)

    # extract results
    a, b = sol[1:end-1], sol[end]

    # do prediction
    yp = X * a .+ b'

For a matrix of column-stored regressors ``X`` and a matrix comprised of multiple columns of dependent variables ``Y``:

.. code-block:: julia

    # prepare data
    X = rand(3, 1000)
    A0, b0 = rand(3, 5), rand(1, 5)
    Y = (X' * A0 .+ b0) + 0.1 * randn(1000, 5)

    # solve using llsq
    sol = llsq(X, Y, dims=2)

    # extract results
    A, b = sol[1:end-1,:], sol[end,:]

    # do prediction
    Yp = X'*A .+ b'


Ridge Regression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compared to linear least square, `Ridge Regression <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization>`_ uses an additional quadratic term to regularize the problem:

.. math::

    \mathop{\mathrm{minimize}}_{(\mathbf{a}, b)} \
    \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{y} - (\mathbf{X} \mathbf{a} + b)\|^2 +
    \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{a}

The transposed form:

.. math::

    \mathop{\mathrm{minimize}}_{(\mathbf{a}, b)} \
    \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{y} - (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{a} + b)\|^2 +
    \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{a}

The package provides ``ridge`` to solve these problems:

.. function:: ridge(X, y, r; ...)

    Solve the ridge regression problem formulated above.

    Here, ``y`` can be either a vector, or a matrix where each column is a response vector.

    The argument ``r`` gives the quadratic regularization matrix ``Q``, which can be in either of the following forms:

    - ``r`` is a real scalar, then ``Q`` is considered to be ``r * eye(n)``, where ``n`` is the dimension of ``a``.
    - ``r`` is a real vector, then ``Q`` is considered to be ``diagm(r)``.
    - ``r`` is a real symmetric matrix, then ``Q`` is simply considered to be ``r``.

    This function accepts two keyword arguments:

    - ``dims``: whether input observations are stored as rows (``1``) or columns (``2``). (default is ``1``)
    - ``bias``: whether to include the bias term ``b``. (default is ``true``)

    The function results the solution ``a``.
    In particular, when ``y`` is a vector (matrix), ``a`` is also a vector (matrix). If ``bias`` is true, then the returned array is augmented as ``[a; b]``.
